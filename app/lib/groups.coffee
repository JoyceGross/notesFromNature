      "description":"SERNEC is an organization devoted to making the resources of these nearly 222 regional Herbaria of the Southeast available online, in concurrence with developing global standards, so that all available data can then be studied regionally or globally as one virtual, researchable collection. SERNEC will improve access to specimen data of a richly biodiverse ecological environment, and provide a platform for herbarium curators and plant scientists to exchange ideas, share expertise, and benefit from the value of information shared across institutions."

      "description":"Calbug is an effort to digitize terrestrial arthropod specimen records with a focus on California. Using data from specimens the impacts of climate change and habitat modification will be examined. The project is a collaboration of eight entomological collections in California to digitize museum specimens and thus allow assessment of how species distributions have responded to environmental change. It makes use of a long history of entomological collecting in the region to develop a database of approximately 1 million georeferenced specimens collected over the last century."
      "snippet": "Calbugs digitizes collections of pinned insect specimens drawn from eight of California's major institutions, showcasing the stunning diversity of insect life in our world."
